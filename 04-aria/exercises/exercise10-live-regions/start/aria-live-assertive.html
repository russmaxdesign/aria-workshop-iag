    <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age 
    of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, 
    it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was 
    the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter 
    of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, 
    we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the 
    other way.</p>
